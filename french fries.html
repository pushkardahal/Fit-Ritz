French fries are a popular side dish in fast-food restaurants, burger joints, and in homes across the U.S. The salty snack can be made from scratch using fresh potatoes and your choice of oil and seasoning, but many home cooks use frozen fries, instead. Commercially processed frozen french fries may be made with additional ingredients such as corn starch, rice flour, and artificial flavors.
<br><br>While potatoes—the primary ingredient in french fries—are a lower-calorie, low-fat food, french fries are usually high in fat, calories, and sodium. If you include them in your diet, it's smart to consume french fries in moderation or to use a cooking method that reduces the fat and sodium content.

<h1>French Fries Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one serving (100 grams or about 1/2 cup) of french fries made from fresh potatoes and fried.
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 196</li>
  <li>Fat: 13.1g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 141mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 18.5g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 1.6g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 1.25g</li>
 <li>Protein: 1.93g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are 196 calories and 18.5 grams of carbohydrates in a single serving of french fries. However, calorie counts can vary depending on how the french fries are prepared. For example, fast-food french fries and restaurant french fries tend to be higher in calories and carbs. A single serving of homemade french fries contains about 1.6 grams of fiber and 1.25 grams of naturally-occurring sugar. The rest of the carbohydrate in french fries is starch.

</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">According to USDA data, french fries usually contain about 13g of fat per serving. This includes 1.8g of saturated fat, 5.4g of polyunsaturated fat, and 5.4g of monounsaturated fat.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A single serving of french fries provides about 1.9g of protein.</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">French fries can be a good source of certain vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C (9.7mg), vitamin B6 (0.265mg), and vitamin K (16.3mcg). But again, the nutrients you get from fries can depend on the preparation method. Potato skins are known to contain more nutrients (such as potassium, fiber, and B vitamins), so if you consume fries with the skins still on you may benefit from more vitamins and minerals.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The health benefits that you gain from consuming french fries are likely to come from the nutrients in the potatoes. The oil and seasonings used to prepare standard fries are not likely to contribute any substantial benefits and can come with drawbacks.
</p>
<h1>May Support Healthy Immune Function</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The vitamin C in potatoes may be beneficial in the body. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin necessary for a healthy immune system. It also plays a role in building strong connective tissue and wound repair. Since vitamin C can't be stored in the body, it must be consumed in food. White potatoes provide the nutrient, but other foods including citrus fruits and some dark green vegetables are better sources.
</p>

<h1>May Improve Early Brain Development</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The vitamin B6 supplied by potatoes is important for proper brain development during pregnancy and infancy. In fact, pregnant and breastfeeding women have higher recommended intakes of vitamin B6 than adult men and women (who are not pregnant or breastfeeding).
