<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Cashew Milk Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits</h1></div>

<p style="font-size:180%">
Cashews are known for their creamy texture and satisfying fat content. It’s no surprise, then, that these nuts lend themselves well to a non-dairy milk alternative. Cashew milk has steadily found its place alongside almond, soy, and rice milks as a substitute for cow’s milk in the last several years.

<h1>Cashew Milk Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information for 1 cup (8 ounces) of cashew milk has been provided by the USDA. 
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 156</li>
  <li>Fat: 11g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 100mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 10.5g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 2g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 3g</li>
 <li>Protein: 4.5g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cashews contain some carbohydrates in the form of starch and fiber. In addition, this particular brand of cashew milk uses date sugar to sweeten the beverage and therefore some of the carbohydrates come from that.
</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">If you did a double-take at the 11 grams of fat per serving in cashew milk, here’s some good news: most of the fat in cashews is the healthy, monounsaturated kind. Plant-based monounsaturated fats are associated with benefits like a lower risk of heart disease.1

﻿ Keep in mind, too, that fats in cashew milk will vary depending on a brand’s recipe.</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Protein content can deviate broadly between brands of store-bought cashew milks. Some brands may have as little as 1 gram per 8-ounce serving, while others may provide up to 5 grams. In general, however, this nut milk is not a high protein food.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Commercially prepared cashew milk contains both naturally occurring and added vitamins and minerals. Many brands fortify their beverages with calcium, iron, and vitamins E and D—from 10 to 50% of the recommended daily value. Cashew milk is a source of sodium as well, at about 4% of the daily value per 8 ounces.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">In addition to being a creamy alternative to dairy milk, cashew milk provides a host of health benefits.
</p>
<h1>Boosts Heart Health</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cashew milk’s fats don’t just add flavor and satiation to this beverage—they may promote heart health as well. Studies show a strong correlation between plant-based monounsaturated fats and prevention of cardiovascular disease.
</p>

<h1>Builds Strong Bones</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">When fortified, cashew milk can provide up to 30 percent of the daily value of calcium. This important mineral helps build strong bones and promotes muscle and nerve function.
