<p style="font-size:180%">
Cornstarch is a white, dense powder that is made from the endosperm of corn kernels. It is often used as a thickener in foods such as gravy, soups, and stews. Some cooks use cornstarch instead of flour to get their desired consistency in certain recipes. It is also used in baked goods or to coat meat and vegetables.
<br><br>Corn starch is generally used in very small quantities when added to recipes. It contributes very few calories and no substantial vitamins or minimal. It has a minimal impact on your daily nutrition.

<h1>Cornstarch Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for a one-tablespoon serving (8 grams) of cornstarch.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 30</li>
  <li>Fat: 0g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 0mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 7g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0g</li>
 <li>Protein: 0g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cornstarch provides about 30 calories per tablespoon, primarily from carbohydrates. There are 7 grams of carbohydrates, 0 grams of sugar, and 0 grams of fiber. The carbohydrates in cornstarch come from starch.
<br><br>Despite its high starch content, research has suggested that uncooked cornstarch is a low-glycemic food. Studies indicate that it is absorbed slowly in the digestive system.2

﻿ However, research has also reported that foods with cornstarch (such as stew or pudding) can have a high glycemic index.3﻿

</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There is no fat in a one-tablespoon serving of cornstarch. Even a full cup contains less than a gram of fat.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cornstarch provides no protein. A one-tablespoon serving provides zero grams and even a full cup only provides 0.3 grams.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cornstarch provides no significant vitamins or minerals. Even if it is consumed in larger quantities than is typical in recipes, the powder does not contribute any significant micronutrients.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Many people who use cornstarch occasionally in recipes may not notice any substantial impact on their health by including the powder in their diet. But there are some ways in which cornstarch may be able to impact health outcomes in select circumstances.
</p>
<h1>May Be Helpful in Management of Hypoglycemia</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There is some evidence that a diet that includes uncooked cornstarch may be helpful for those who are managing hypoglycemia.
<br><br>One research review published by the American Diabetes Association examined studies investigating the use of cornstarch-based nighttime snack and its ability to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia, particularly in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In one study, researchers reported that raw cornstarch reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia by serving as a glucose reservoir in the intestinal tract, where it is digested slowly over a period of 6 to 8 hours.
</p>

<h1>Makes Liquids Easier to Swallow</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">People who have difficulty swallowing—a condition called dysphagia—may be able to use cornstarch to increase the viscosity of their liquids to make swallowing easier. Dysphagia is a condition that becomes more common as we age. Thickened liquids are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control. A bolus is a small mass of chewed food. Thickened liquids also help prevent aspiration and improve swallow safety.
