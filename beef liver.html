Beef liver is an organ meat that comes from cattle. The popularity of liver has varied throughout the years with other beef cuts (like flank steak, ribeye, and other cuts) taking center stage more often. But beef liver is now enjoying a moment of popularity as it has become a favorite among those who follow a paleo diet, low carb diets, or carnivore diets.
<br><br>Liver is budget-friendly and full of nutrients. It's packed with protein, and micronutrients including vitamin B12, vitamin A, riboflavin, copper, and iron. While it has a strong taste that can be hard for some to tolerate, this food can make a nutrient-rich addition to your diet.

<h1>Reduced Risk of Anemia</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The substantial amount of vitamin B12 and iron in beef liver can be helpful for those who are at risk for anemia. If you have anemia, your blood has a lower level of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. They also return carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs. People with anemia often report feeling tired or weak and may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, constipation, loss of appetite, and weight loss.
</p>

<h1>Reduced Risk of Vitamin A Deficiency </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Vitamin A deficiency is common in developing countries especially among children, pregnant, and lactating women. In the U.S., vitamin A deficiency is not common except in certain populations such as those with cystic fibrosis. It is estimated that about 15%â€“40% of patients with cystic fibrosis don't get enough of this vital nutrient.
