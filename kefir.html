Kefir is typically made by fermenting cow, goat, or sheep milk using a bacterial culture of polysaccharides called kefiran.

﻿ As these bacteria get to work on fermentation, they create high doses of probiotics and a fizzy pop some people say is similar
 to that of beer. In taste and texture, kefir has a thin, drinkable consistency. Its flavor is strong and tangy. 

<br><br>Long touted by holistic health practitioners as a remedy for everything from acne to depression, kefir isn’t just for the 
alt-medicine crowd. High in calcium and probiotics, this creamy beverage with Eastern European roots has documented health benefits 
everyone can enjoy. </p>

<h1>Kefir Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">This nutrition information, for 1 cup (8 oz.) of plain kefir is provided by the USDA.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 139</li>
  <li>Fat: 8g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 91mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 9g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 7g</li>
 <li>Protein: 8g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Although kefir is an animal product, which some people associate with low levels of carbohydrates, it’s not carb-free. 
This is due to naturally occurring sugars in its milk base. However, the fermentation that turns milk into kefir “eats” some of 
these sugars. Compared to an 8-ounce glass of 2% milk, which contains 12 grams of carbs, an 8-ounce serving of kefir contains just 9 grams.</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">When converting milk to kefir, fermentation won’t change its fat content. Made with whole milk, kefir contains 8 grams of fat
Whole milk’s fat composition skews toward the saturated variety, with 62% saturated, 30% monounsaturated, and 4% polyunsaturated fats.</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Like a glass of milk, 8 ounces of kefir provides 8 grams of complete protein. This means it contains all the essential amino
 acids your body can’t produce on its own.</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">As a dairy product, kefir is high in calcium. One serving provides 300 milligrams, or 30% of the Daily Value. You’ll also find modest 
amounts of vitamin A (6% DV) and sodium (4% DV) in an 8-ounce glass.</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are many ways drinking kefir can positively impact your health.</p>

<h1>Supports the Immune System</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Research shows that eating fermented foods comes with a variety of benefits, including building a healthier immune system. 
The live cultures in kefir cultivate a healthy microbiome, which supports immunity.</p>

<h1>May Reduce Constipation </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">When you’re all stopped up, a bit of kefir may help. In a 2014 study of 20 subjects with chronic constipation, drinking 500 milliliters
 (about 17 ounces) of kefir a day for four weeks improved the frequency and consistency of bowel movements.Despite saturated fat’s negative
 reputation, however, many experts believe that, 
when consumed in whole dairy, it offers protective effects for heart health.</p>
