Kale chips are a crunchy snack made with kale leaves (Brassica oleracea). The dark green leaves are either fried, baked, or dehydrated under low heat. Kale chip products may include other ingredients such as cashews, sunflower seeds, tahini, and a variety of seasonings for flavor. While kale chips used to be found only in health food stores, the snack is now commonly found in most grocery stores' snack aisle.
