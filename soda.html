<p style="font-size:180%">
Back in the late 1800s and early-to-mid 1900s, soda was the almighty beverage. Millions of people enjoyed soda every day, and as the famed Coca-Cola grew in popularity, more and more brands of soda began appearing on store shelves. 
<br><br>Because there are so many brands and types of soda on the market, we chose one of the most popular and well-known types of soda to break down in this article. The following information about soda nutrition facts is for Coca-Cola, but following the nutrition facts, you’ll learn about varieties of soda and the health effects of soda in general.
</p>
<br><br>

<h1>Soda Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">This nutrition information for one 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 140</li>
  <li>Fat: 0g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 43.2mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 39g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 39g</li>
 <li>Protein: 0g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">One 12-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of carbohydrates, all of which come from added sugar. The 2020-2025 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans stipulate that people should limit their daily sugar intake to just 10 percent of their total calorie intake.2﻿﻿ For someone who eats 2,000 calories per day, that equals 50 grams of sugar—just one can of Coca-Cola leaves you with only 11 grams of sugar to spare on a 2,000 calorie diet.
</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Coca-Cola contains no fat. This can be perceived as a good thing or a bad thing—the beverage is free from harmful trans fats, but it’s also void of healthy dietary fats, such as omega-3s and omega-6s.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Coca-Cola also contains no protein, so it doesn’t offer any of the benefits that dietary protein offers, such as muscle growth,5﻿ appetite control,6﻿ tissue repair,7﻿ bone health,8﻿ and healthy aging.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Soda is typically void of vitamins and minerals, including Coca-Cola. According to the USDA food database1﻿ , a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola contains no essential nutrients, such as potassium, calcium, or iron. It also does not contain any vitamin A, C, E, D, K, or B.  
<br><br>Coca-Cola does contain some sodium (43.2 grams in a 12-ounce serving). </p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">It’s common knowledge these days that soda isn’t good for your health. Drinking soda, especially the conventional kind with tons of sugar, has been linked to several health complications, including chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.</p>

<h1>Adverse Effects</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">It’s common knowledge these days that soda isn’t good for your health. Drinking soda, especially the conventional kind with tons of sugar, has been linked to several health complications, including chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.
</p>

<h1>Type 2 Diabetes </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Sugary drinks like soda have been linked to type 2 diabetes.13﻿ Researchers believe soda contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes because of the high sugar content, which can lead to insulin resistance.</p>
