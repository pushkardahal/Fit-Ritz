Rice is a starchy grain used as a staple ingredient by more than half the world's population largely due to its versatility, availability, and ability to adapt to any flavor and seasoning. Rice has a chewiness and soft texture that adds substance to meals and complements many cuisines.
<br><br>There are many different types of rice and ways to prepare it, and nutritional values differ as well. Most notably, brown rice is a whole grain while white rice is a refined grain and a processed food.

<h1>Rice Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 cup (186g) of cooked, enriched, short-grain white rice.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 242</li>
  <li>Fat: 0.4g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 0mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 53.4g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0.6g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0g</li>
 <li>Protein: 4.4g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are over 53 grams of carbohydrate in a single serving of white rice. Only a tiny amount of that carbohydrate comes from fiber. Most of it is starch and a small amount is sugar.
<br><br>The glycemic index of white rice is estimated to be 73. The glycemic index of brown rice, on the other hand, is estimated to be about 68. Short-grain rice tends to have a higher glycemic index than long-grain, medium-grain, and brown rice.
<br><br>Brown rice also has fewer carbohydrates than white rice at 49.6g per cup.</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There is almost no fat in rice, as long as you cook it without adding any oil or butter.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are over 4 grams of protein in a 1-cup serving of white rice, and about 5 grams in the same size serving of brown rice.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Rice can serve as a good source of B vitamins (including thiamin, niacin, and riboflavin) and iron. Rice is also an excellent source of manganese and magnesium.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Rice can be part of a balanced diet, particularly if you choose the unprocessed, brown rice varieties. Many of the health benefits of rice come from the vitamins and minerals that it provides.
</p>
<h1>Supports Bones, Nerves, and Muscles</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Magnesium is the structural component of bones that assists in hundreds of enzyme reactions involved in the synthesis of DNA and proteins and is required for proper nerve conduction and muscle contraction.
</p>

<h1>Improves Colon Health </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Rice contains resistant starch, which can lead to the formation of certain fatty acids that help the colon stay healthy. These fatty acids may also decrease the risk of colorectal cancer
