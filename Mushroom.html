Chanterelle mushrooms (Cantharellus cibarius) are a yellow or yellow-orange mushroom commonly grown in hardwood forests throughout Europe. Chanterelles are also grown in other parts of the world, including North America. Those who pick chanterelles are familiar with their fruity, apricot-like odor. Also called "girole" or "girolle" in France, these mushrooms are often added to pasta and other savory dishes.
<br><br>Chanterelles and other types of mushrooms have a meaty texture that can provide heartiness to meat-free dishes. The mushrooms are very low in calories and provide fiber and other nutrients such as vitamin D and copper.

<h1>Chanterelle Mushroom Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 cup (54g) of raw chanterelle mushrooms.
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 17.3</li>
  <li>Fat: 0.3g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 4.9mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 3.7g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 2.1g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0.6g</li>
 <li>Protein: 0.8g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Chanterelle mushrooms provide 17 calories in a full cup serving. The total carb count is only 3.7 grams. Two grams of carbohydrate comes from beneficial fiber.
<br><br>The glycemic index of chanterelles (specifically) is not known. But the glycemic load of a one-cup serving of raw mushrooms is estimated to be 2, making them a low glycemic food. Glycemic load takes portion size into account when estimating a food's impact on blood glucose.</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There is almost no fat in chanterelle mushrooms. A single serving provides just 0.3 grams. However, if you cook them in oil or butter your fat intake will increase.</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Chanterelle mushrooms contain a small amount of protein, just 0.8 grams per one-cup serving. However, even though they're not a substantial source of this macronutrient, they do provide all of the essential amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Your body doesn't make all of them, so some of them (called essential amino acids) must be consumed in food.

</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Mushrooms are a good source of vitamins including riboflavin (about 10% of your recommended intake), niacin (about 15%), and vitamin D (about 19%). Chanterelle mushrooms are an excellent source of copper, an essential mineral that helps your body maintain a healthy nervous system and immune function. Copper is also important for brain development.</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Different types of mushrooms and mushroom extracts have been used as natural remedies for hundreds of years by Greeks, Romans, and in traditional Chinese medicine. Recent research investigating the benefits of mushrooms in general and chanterelles specifically has found that this wholesome food can provide health benefits.


</p>
<h1>Improved Immune Function</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Mushrooms such as chanterelles are known to contain flavonoids including myricetin and catechin.3﻿ They are also known to contain phenolic acids that have valuable immune-boosting properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic properties.</p>

<h1>Better Heart Health</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The fiber in mushrooms is useful for cholesterol reduction.6﻿ In addition, mushrooms are known to contain ergosterol,1﻿ a type of sterol that has antioxidant properties and is important in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
<br><br>Since mushrooms are naturally low in sodium and almost entirely fat-free, mushrooms can be a heart-healthy food, especially when consumed instead of fatty meats.</p>
