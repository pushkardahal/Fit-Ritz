<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Ghee Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits</h1></div>
<img src="ghee.webp" width="850" height="500">

<p style="font-size:180%">Ghee is a type of clarified or drawn butter with origins in Indian cooking. Clarification is the cooking process that separates milk solids and water from fat. In ghee, the butter is cooked longer than in clarified butter, allowing milk solids to brown before they are strained out. This gives ghee a richer, nuttier flavor than traditional clarified butter.
<br><br>For thousands of years, ghee has been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a curative for a number of ailments. The clarification process is believed to remove impurities, leaving behind a healthier product.
<br><br>Clarification does remove milk solids, decreasing the lactose and casein content of ghee. This may offer benefits to people who have a milk allergy or sensitivity. However, research is ongoing as to whether ghee offers measurable health benefits, especially as compared to regular butter. Ghee should still be used in small quantities to enhance other foods, as you would butter or oils.

<h1>Ghee Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">This nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one tablespoon (15g) of ghee.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 130</li>
  <li>Fat: 15g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 0mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 0g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0g</li>
 <li>Protein: 0g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Since ghee is almost completely pure fat, it doesnâ€™t contain any carbohydrates.</p>

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Like most cooking oils, ghee is very close to 100% fat. One tablespoon has 15 grams of fat, 9 grams of which are saturated fat. The remaining fat content is divided between about 5 grams of healthier monounsaturated fat and less than one gram of polyunsaturated fat.</p>
 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Ghee may contain trace amounts of protein that is leftover if the milk solids (whey) aren't completely removed in the clarification process.</p>



<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The micronutrient content of ghee can vary by brand and the diet of the cows that supplied its milk. In general, a one-tablespoon serving contains about 8% of the recommended daily intake (RDI) of vitamin A, 2% of vitamin E, and 1% of vitamin K.</p>



<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Ayurvedic medicine promotes ghee as a natural means of improving memory, increasing flexibility, and promoting healthy digestion.

<br><br>However, the jury is still out on whether scientific evidence supports the health claims around ghee. For instance, one animal study found no difference in memory or cognition from a diet that included ghee rather than regular butter; there is no research on how ghee might help with memory in humans.</p>

<h1>Soothes and Heals Skin</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">In addition to eating ghee, some people apply it topically as a creamy salve for wounds, burns, or rashes. Research has confirmed that ghee does contain healing properties for skin due to antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, most likely because of its vitamin A and E content. However, some studies looked at ghee in combination with honey, which has its own beneficial properties.</p>


<h1>Limits Exposure to Acrylamide </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Acrylamide is a potentially toxic and carcinogenic compound that is produced when cooking fats are exposed to high heat.</p>
