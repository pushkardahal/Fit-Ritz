<p style="font-size:180%">
Fried chicken tenders are commonly found on fast-food menus or in the frozen food section of the grocery store. Sometimes called chicken strips or chicken nuggets, they may be prepared with boneless chicken breast, rib meat, or with other parts of the chicken. In most, cases the tenders are breaded with seasoning before being fried.
<br><br>While different parts of chicken provide nutrients and can be part of a healthy diet, fried foods usually provide high amounts of fat and sodium. If you choose fried chicken tenders for a meal or snack, it may be smart to keep portion size in mind.

<h1>Fried Chicken Tenders Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for a single serving (184g) of fast-food chicken tenders.
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 499</li>
  <li>Fat: 25.7g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 1410mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 31.7g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 2.2g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0.7g</li>
 <li>Protein: 35.4g</li>
 
</ul>

<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A single serving of chicken tenders provides 499 calories and 31.7 grams of carbs. The breading provides a small amount of fiber (2.2 grams) and may even provide a small amount of sugar, although the actual count can vary on the brand that you consume.
</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Even though chicken breast is a low-fat food, fried chicken tenders tend to be high in fat because oil is used to fry them. USDA data indicates that a single serving provides nearly 26 grams of fat. Of that, 4.6 grams is saturated fat, about 9 grams is monounsaturated fat, and about 10.6 is polyunsaturated fat. Again, those numbers can vary based on the brand.

</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Fried chicken tenders are a good source of protein with a single serving providing 35.4 grams of the muscle-building nutrient. If you are a young adult, this protein exceeds your needs in a single sitting, with the recommendation between 20-25 grams of protein per meal.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Fried chicken tenders are an excellent source of selenium, niacin, vitamin B6, and phosphorus, each providing more than 40% of your daily value set by the FDA.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">While chicken breast and other parts of the chicken can offer many important health benefits, if you choose to consume poultry in the form of fried chicken tenders, you need to balance the health advantages with some drawbacks.
<br><br>In addition, the food provides almost 26 grams or 234 calories from fat. USDA guidelines suggest consuming no more than 20–35% of total calories from fat. For those who consume 2000 calories per day, a single serving of this food provides more than 10% of that allowance—in just one part of a single meal.
</p>
<h1>Helps to Build Muscle Mass</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Protein helps your body maintain muscle mass. Chicken provides the important amino acids your body needs to repair tissue so that you keep the muscles that you have. It also helps your body to build muscle when you participate in a strength training program.
</p>

<h1>May Help Strengthen Bones </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Research shows that protein can work with calcium to help protect bones. So it can be helpful to consume enough protein to keep bones strong and healthy. You can increase your protein intake by consuming both meat and plant-based sources of protein.</p>
