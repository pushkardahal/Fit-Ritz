The cashew nut is grown in Vietnam, Nigeria, India, and on the Ivory Coast, but it is native to Brazil. The nut is a product of the evergreen cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale) that produces both a fruit (also called an apple) and a nut (also called a seed) that hangs beneath the fruit.
<br><br>Cashews are consumed as a snack on their own, are commonly used in nut mixes, and can also be processed into cashew butter, cashew milk, and other products. Cashews can be a healthy addition to your diet when consumed in moderation.

<h1>Kefir Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 ounce (28g) of raw, unsalted cashews
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 157</li>
  <li>Fat: 12g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 3.4mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 8.6g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0.9g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 1.7g</li>
 <li>Protein: 5.2g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A single serving of cashew nuts is 1 ounce—or about 18 nuts.2﻿ One serving contains 157 calories and just under 9 grams of carbohydrate. Most of the carbohydrate in cashews is starch. A small amount is fiber (just under 1 gram) and the rest (about 1.7 grams) is sugar.
</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Most of the calories in cashews come from fat. There are 12 grams of fat in a serving if you consume the full ounce. Most of the fat is monounsaturated fat (6.8g) or polyunsaturated fat (2.2g). Unsaturated fats are considered to be healthier forms of fat.3

﻿ There are also about 2.2 grams of less healthy saturated fat in a serving of cashews.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cashew nuts provide just over 5 grams of protein per serving. As a basis for comparison, cashews provide less protein than peanuts, which provide over 7 grams per one-ounce serving.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cashew nuts provide vitamin K (about 12% of your daily needs). You'll also benefit from thiamin and vitamin B6 when you consume cashews.
<br><br>
Cashews are an excellent source of magnesium, phosphorus, copper, and manganese and a good source of zinc and iron.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Consumption of nuts in general—and cashews, in particular—is associated with certain health benefits.
</p>
<h1>Aids Weight Control</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Nuts can make a smart snack if you are trying to lose weight. The healthy fat, protein, and fiber in nuts may help you to feel full and satisfied after meals or at snacktime. But since nuts are high in calories, it's important to consume them in moderation.
</p>

<h1>May Help Decrease Cholesterol</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Cashews may help lower LDL cholesterol in some adults, according to a study published in a 2017 issue of the journal Nutrients. Researchers found that when adults with mildly high cholesterol consumed 28 to 64 grams of cashews per day, they saw an average 24% decrease in LDL cholesterol when compared to a control diet.
