If you're a healthy eater, you probably have yogurt in your refrigerator. The dairy food provides nutritional benefits especially for people who are looking to boost gastrointestinal health,1

﻿ trying to lose weight or improve their health. But some brands of yogurt can be high in sugar, fat, and calories depending on the type that you buy. Compare yogurt nutrition and yogurt calories to choose the right product for your diet.

<h1>Yogurt Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 cup (8 ounces or 235g) of plain whole milk yogurt.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 149</li>
  <li>Fat: 8g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 113mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 11.4g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 11.4g</li>
 <li>Protein: 8.5g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">Plain yogurt is simply yogurt that contains no added fruit, flavoring, or added sugars. Many people use plain yogurt in recipes or as a replacement for sour cream in dips and sauces. Plain yogurt is an excellent source of calcium and is high in phosphorus and riboflavin.1﻿ But it also provides more naturally-occurring sugar (from lactose) and saturated fat than most people would expect to find in a "healthy" food.</p>

<h1>Yogurt Calories by Brand</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">If you are watching your waistline, you might choose yogurt as a snack or meal. Low-fat and non-fat yogurt is likely to have fewer calories, but there is also some evidence that full fat dairy can also be included in a successful weight loss program.3﻿ Here's how some of the popular brands of plain yogurt stack up per serving.</p>



<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Foods that contain protein promote "satiety" or fullness.4﻿ So if you eat yogurt for breakfast or lunch, you may not be as likely to get hunger cravings shortly after your meal. The protein in traditional or Greek yogurt can also help your body to build and maintain muscle.<br><br>
Yogurt is also a good way to boost your calcium intake, especially if you are a non-milk drinker. The wide range of flavors available makes it easy for even the pickiest eater to find a flavor that he or she likes.</p>

<h1>Is Plain or Flavored Yogurt Healthier?</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">When consumers choose yogurt to eat as a snack or with a meal, they often choose flavored yogurt because it has a sweeter taste. But it is also higher in sugar and may be higher in calories. A single 150-gram serving of Dannon Strawberry yogurt, for example, provides 15 grams of sugar and 140 calories (almost the same number of calories as the much larger serving of plain yogurt indicated on the label). A single serving of Yoplait Original Strawberry yogurt contains 150 calories, 2 grams of fat and 18 grams of sugar.</p>


<h1>Greek Yogurt vs. Traditional Yogurt </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Greek yogurt is another popular option for healthy eaters. Greek yogurt is thicker and less sweet than traditional yogurt. The product is strained to remove much of the sugar, lactose and liquid whey. As a result, some brands of Greek yogurt have less sugar and more protein than traditional versions of yogurt.<br><br>
So how does Greek yogurt nutrition compare to traditional yogurt? Greek yogurt calories are usually about the same. Fage Total 2% Plain Yogurt provides 150 calories, 4 grams of fat and 20 grams of protein. It also provides eight grams of sugar.
