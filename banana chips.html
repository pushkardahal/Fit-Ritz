<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Banana Chip Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits</h1></div>

<p style="font-size:180%">
Banana chips are a sweet treat made by frying thin slices of underripe bananas (Musa acuminata) and drizzling them with sugar or honey. Some home cooks also make banana chips by baking or dehydrating banana slice
<br><br>While raw bananas can provide healthy nutrients (such as fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C), banana chips don't provide significant vitamins or minerals because a single serving is relatively small and uses only a small part of the whole banana. Since banana chips can be rich in fat and sugar, this snack should be consumed in moderation.

<h1>Banana Chip Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition data is provided by the USDA for 1 cup of banana chips (72 grams).
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 374</li>
  <li>Fat: 24.2g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 4.3mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 42g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 5.5g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 25g</li>
 <li>Protein: 1.7g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are 374 calories and over 40 grams of carbohydrates in a cup of banana chips, which generally contains a few servings. One cup also provides about 5 grams of fiber and about 25 grams of sugar. The sugar in banana chips comes from a combination of sugar that occurs naturally in bananas and sugar that is added during processing to make the chips sweeter.
</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are about 24g of fat in a serving of banana chips. About 20 grams of fat is saturated fat, 1.4g is monounsaturated, and 0.5g is polyunsaturated.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A cup of banana chips provides only 1.7 grams of protein.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Banana chips are not a significant source of any vitamins or minerals.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">While a whole raw banana can provide certain health benefits, you're not likely to gain these benefits when you consume a single serving of banana chips. If you consume enough fried banana chips to get the same vitamins and minerals provided by a whole banana, you'll also end up consuming substantial fat, carbohydrates, and calories.
</p>
<h1>May Aid Weight Loss</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Banana chips may be a healthier alternative to potato chips even when they are fried. According to USDA data, a comparable serving of potato chips provides about the same number of calories as banana chips, but less than one gram (0.6g) of fiber. Banana chips provide over a gram.
</p>

<h1>May Reduce Constipation </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Bananas can be a good source of potassium. Potassium is known to have beneficial effects on blood pressure, especially when paired with a low-sodium eating plan.
<br><br>Banana chips may provide a very small amount of potassium. But this snack is also likely to be lower in sodium than comparable snacks like crackers or potato chips. A single serving of banana chips provides less than one gram (0.84mg) of sodium according to USDA data, whereas a similar serving of potato chips provides 95mg of sodium.
