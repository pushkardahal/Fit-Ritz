<p style="font-size:180%">
Lentils are an inexpensive, versatile, easy-to-find source of healthy carbohydrates. These disc-shaped pulses make a nutritious base for soups, salads, and a variety of other dishes. A pulse is the seed of a legume.
<br><br> There are different sizes and different types of lentils. You're likely to find green lentils or brown lentils on local grocery store shelves, but there are also lentil varieties including split red lentils, orange, red, yellow, and black lentils. Lentils' impressive nutrition facts, long shelf-life, and easy cooking make them a smart and healthy addition to any diet.

<h1>Lentil Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 cup (180g) of cooked lentils with no added fat or salt.
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 207</li>
  <li>Fat: 0.1g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 355mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 36.1g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 14.2g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 3.2g</li>
 <li>Protein: 16.2g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A one-cup serving of lentils that has been cooked with no added fat or sodium provides 207 calories, most of which comes from carbohydrate. You'll benefit from over 14 grams of fiber when you consume a cup of lentils. Fiber helps to stabilize blood sugar, lower cholesterol, boost satiety, and improve digestive health.
</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There is almost no fat in lentils, which makes them a naturally fat-free food. However, many cooks add fat such as olive oil when they cook lentils, and that will change the nutrition facts.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Each 1 cup serving of lentils provides a healthy 16 grams of protein. For this reason, many vegans and vegetarians use lentils to boost their protein intake. However, lentils are not considered a complete protein. Complete proteins provide all of the essential amino acids that cannot be made by the body and therefore must be consumed in the diet.
<br><br>You'll need to combine lentils with a whole grain or with seeds in order to get all essential amino acids at mealtime.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Lentils are packed with nutrients. You'll get 81% of your daily recommended intake of folate if you consume a cup of lentils. Folate, a B vitamin, helps boost red blood cell production and provides other health benefits.
<br><br>Lentils are also rich in thiamin, phosphorus, iron, potassium, copper, and manganese. They are a good source of niacin, vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, magnesium, and zinc. These pulses also provide smaller amounts of vitamin C, vitamin K, riboflavin, calcium, and selenium
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Several studies have shown that legume consumption is associated with a lower risk of different types of heart disease. In fact, several heart-healthy diets, including the DASH diet (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) and Mediterranean-style diet plans promote an increased intake of plant-based foods such as legumes for the heart-healthy benefits that they provide.4ï»¿ Lentils are part of the legume family, along with beans and peas.
<br><br>A nutritional analysis of lentils has shown that the polyphenol-rich seeds have the ability to provide cardioprotective effects including reducing the risk of hypertension and coronary artery diseases. Human studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies have suggested that lentils may provide a cardioprotective effect.
</p>
<h1>May Help Decrease Cholesterol</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A review published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that including pulses like lentils helps to lower LDL cholesterol (also called "bad" cholesterol).
</p>

<h1>Obesity Prevention</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">An evaluation of the nutritional value of legumes published in Obesity Reviews determined that "replacing energy-dense foods with legumes has been shown to have beneficial effects on the prevention and management of obesity and related disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome."
