Turmeric tea is an herbal tea that comes from the Curcuma longa plant. It is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral properties as well as other proven medicinal benefits.
</p>
<br><br>

<h1>What Is Turmeric Tea?</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Turmeric is often used as a spice in various cuisines. It is part of the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family and comes predominantly from India. For thousands of years, the benefits of turmeric spices and teas have been harnessed in Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine.

<h1>How to Prepare</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">To make turmeric tea, you will need a turmeric tea bag, one serving of loose turmeric tea, or 1 teaspoon of powdered or grated turmeric. You can add loose turmeric tea or turmeric powder directly to your teacup or use a tea infuser.
<br><br>Place turmeric tea—either a tea bag, serving of loose leaf tea, or serving of powdered turmeric—in a teacup.
<br><br>Many teas are made of dried leaves, but turmeric tea is made by brewing grated, dried, or powdered turmeric. It is a desirable tea because it contains high amounts of curcumin, a chemical compound known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Experts recommend consuming turmeric with black pepper since it can increase the bioavailability of curcumin by up to 2000%.
<br><br>You can make turmeric yourself by brewing fresh turmeric in hot water. You can also buy turmeric tea in tea bags or loose tea. In loose teas, turmeric is often blended with other spices like ginger, black pepper, cardamom, and cloves.
<br><br>Bring water to a boil, then let it sit for 1 minute to slightly reduce the temperature. The ideal brewing temperature is 212° Fahrenheit or 100° Celsius.
<br><br>Pour eight ounces of hot water over the turmeric tea bag, loose tea, or powdered turmeric.
<br><br>Simmer the tea for 5-10 minutes. If using freshly grated turmeric, allow the tea to steep for up to 15 minutes.
<br><br>Strain the tea into another container for a smoother tea or enjoy it as is. Add sweetener, milk, or juice as desired.

<h1>Caffeine Content</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Since turmeric tea is an herbal tea, it does not contain high amounts of caffeine. Turmeric is naturally caffeine-free. This makes it desirable for people who are sensitive to caffeine or actively avoid it. Though turmeric tea does not contain caffeine, it is considered to be a caffeine-free alternative to coffee since it can naturally boost energy levels.

<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are a few notable health benefits to drinking turmeric tea.</p>
<h1>Anti-Inflammatory Propertiess</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Turmeric is well-known for its anti-inflammatory benefits. This is due to the active ingredient curcumin, which may reduce inflammation in the body. Because of this, it is often recommended for people with arthritis, liver damage, Alzheimer’s, lung conditions, and other inflammatory health conditions.</p>


<h1>Immune Boosting Functions</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The antioxidant content in turmeric tea makes it ideal for boosting immune function. It is considered a remedy for cold and flu symptoms since it also has antiviral and anti-microbial properties.
