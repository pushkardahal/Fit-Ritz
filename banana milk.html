With rising rates of food allergies—including dairy—many people are seeking a solution that can provide the creaminess of milk without the potential for allergy. At your local grocery store or coffee shop, you’ve probably noticed the influx of milk derived from non-traditional ingredients like nuts, oats, soy, and even peas. Now, there’s a new type of milk made from another surprising source: bananas.
 </p>

<h1>Kefir Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">As of January 2020, the USDA does not provide nutrition information for banana milk. Nutrition may vary from brand to brand, so for the most accurate information, check the label on banana milk you’ve purchased. The following nutrition facts are for 1 cup (8 oz.) of Mooala brand banana milk.
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories:60</li>
  <li>Fat: 3g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 15mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 9g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 1g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 4g</li>
 <li>Protein: 1g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The carbohydrates in banana milk come from the naturally occurring sugar, fiber, and starches in bananas, as well a small amount of carbs from sunflower seeds. These types of carbohydrates are natural, not processed, or added. Fiber is a complex carbohydrate and can help to regulate appetite and blood sugar. If you’re watching your carb intake, banana milk may make a better choice than cow’s milk, since it contains nine grams per cup, compared to dairy milk’s 12.
</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Because its two primary ingredients—water and bananas—are fat-free, banana milk is relatively low in fat. The small amount of fat it does contain is supplied by sunflower seeds, and is mostly the healthier, unsaturated variety. One cup of banana milk has no detectable saturated fat, and no trans fats, which are associated with cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. 
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Banana milk doesn’t contain a lot of protein, at just one gram per cup, so don’t expect it to add much to your daily requirement. Compared to the eight grams of protein in cow or soy milk, this is especially low.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">When you think of nutrients in bananas, you probably think of potassium. Like the fruit, banana milk does supply a significant amount of this mineral. A one-cup serving of banana milk provides 360mg of potassium, or 10% of your daily requirement. But the nutrients don’t stop there. Bananas are naturally rich in vitamin B6, which helps the immune and nervous systems function properly. Banana milk is also often fortified with calcium. A single serving of Mooala’s original flavor knocks out 30% of your daily value. 
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">In addition to its rich potassium content, banana milk provides numerous benefits.
</p>
<h1>Allergy-Friendly Alternative</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">For many people, banana milk is a welcome alternative when dairy and nut allergies limit milk options. Bananas are not among the “top eight” foods that account for 90% of food allergies in the United States, so they’re not likely to cause allergic symptoms. However, if you are allergic to sunflower seeds, you must also avoid banana milk.
</p>

<h1>Low Calorie for Weight Loss </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Those looking to cut calories for weight loss will find a friend in banana milk. At 60 calories per cup, it contains half the calories of cow’s milk. Substituting banana milk for dairy milk is a simple way to reduce calories in baked goods, smoothies, and at mealtimes as part of a weight-loss plan.</p>
