<p style="font-size:180%">
Duck, while often associated with a high fat content, is more nutrient-dense than you might think. It contains mostly healthy unsaturated fat, yet still has a rich, meaty flavor. Most cooking methods involve preparing the duck so that the majority of the fat is rendered off, leaving crispy skin and lean meat. The rendered duck fat can be used as a healthier alternative to butter or other animal fats used in cooking.
<br><br>Duck meat is extremely flavorful and nutrient dense. It's an excellent source of protein and healthy fat as well as micronutrients including selenium, iron, and niacin. Duck eggs are also nutrient dense with a similar nutrient profile to chicken eggs (with higher amounts per egg because duck eggs are larger than chicken eggs.)

<h1>Duck Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">This nutrition information, for one 3-ounce (85g) roasted skinless Pekin duck breast, is provided by the USDA.1﻿ The Pekin breed is the most commonly consumed type of duck in the U.S. </p>

  <li>Calories: 119</li>
  <li>Fat: 2g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 89mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 0g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0g</li>
 <li>Protein: 23.5g</li>
 
</ul>

<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Duck alone does not contain any carbohydrates (which means it does not have any fiber or sugar).
</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Duck contains a lot of fat between the skin and meat, but it doesn't contain marbled fat throughout the muscle like beef. This visible fat has given duck a reputation for being high in fat. However, the amount of overall fat content will vary significantly based on whether or not duck is cooked and consumed with or without the skin.
<br><br>In fact, without skin and visible fat, duck meat has less fat than roasted skinless chicken breasts. For example, skinless duck breast provides only 2g total fat (0.5g of which is saturated fat) per 3-ounce portion. The same portion of roasted skinless chicken breast provides 3g total fat (1g of which is saturated fat). As with chicken, duck legs and thighs have slightly more total fat (a 3-ounce portion of skinless duck legs contains 5g total fat), but duck legs still contain less fat than skinless chicken thighs.
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Duck meat provides high-quality protein with a variety of non-essential and essential amino acids. 
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Duck contains a variety of micronutrients, including iron, selenium, and a small amount of vitamin C. It contains a variety of B vitamins but is particularly high in niacin and B-12.  Like other B vitamins, niacin plays an important role in converting carbohydrates into glucose and metabolizing fats and proteins. B-12 is essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. 
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Duck is an animal protein that provides some of the beneficial nutrients common in red meat (such as iron), without as much saturated fat as red meat.
</p>
<h1>Boosts the Immune System</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Duck (along with Brazil nuts, fish, and other animal proteins) is a good source of selenium, an important antioxidant that can help prevent cell damage and fight inflammation, both of which support the body's immune system.</p>

<h1>Supports Thyroid Health</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Consuming an adequate amount of selenium is also important for thyroid health.3

﻿ A 3-ounce portion of Pekin duck meat provides over 50% of the daily value for selenium.</p>
