<p style="font-size:180%">
Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is a dark blue berry also known as the European blueberry. The fruit is very similar to the American blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) but can be smaller and darker. Inside, the flesh is dark, soft, and juicy. The flavor is similar to a blueberry but is sometimes described as more intense. In many areas of the U.S. the terms huckleberry, bilberry, whortleberry, and blueberry are used interchangeably.
<br><br>The health benefits of bilberries are still widely promoted. Bilberry supplements are sold in many natural food stores. Not all of the health benefits of bilberries are supported by scientific evidence. though.

<h1>Bilberry Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Many media sources that provide nutritional information for bilberries simply provide the numbers for blueberries because the fruits are so closely related. The USDA does not provide nutrition information specifically for bilberries, but they do provide limited nutrition information for Alaskan-sourced huckleberries. The following information is for a 100g serving (about a half cup) of fresh, raw huckleberries.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 37</li>
  <li>Fat: 0.1g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 10mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 8.7g</li>
 <li>Protein: 0.4g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A half-cup serving of huckleberries contains about 37 calories. Most of the calories are carbohydrates. A similar serving of blueberries contains the same number of calories and carbs.
<br><br>The glycemic index of bilberry has not been established. However, the glycemic index of blueberries is 53. The glycemic load is estimated to be 4, making them a low glycemic food.</p>

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There is no fat in bilberries if you eat the fresh berries.</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Bilberries provide a very small amount of protein, around less than one gram.</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Like most berries, bilberries provide vitamin C—about 2.8 mg per serving. Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant and helps to protect cells in your body from damage caused by free radicals.
<br><br>Bilberries also contain phenolic compounds, including flavonols (3 mg of quercetin and 20 mg of catechins), tannins, ellagitannins, phenolic acids, and most notably anthocyanins. In fact, bilberry has a higher anthocyanin content when compared to other types of berries, such as strawberry, cranberry, elderberry, sour cherry, and raspberry.</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are many ways drinking kefir can positively impact your health.</p>

<h1>Reduced Inflammation</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">One study published in Molecular Nutrition and Food Research investigated how bilberries might benefit those with metabolic syndrome. After an 8-week investigation, study authors concluded that a diet high in bilberries may reduce low‐grade inflammation indicating decreased cardiometabolic risk in the long term.
</p>

<h1>Dental Health </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Another interesting study investigated the relationship between bilberry consumption and dental health. It appears that bilberry intake may have an impact on gingival inflammation-reducing gingivitis to a similar extent as standard dental care.9 The study participants who showed improvement consumed 250 or 500 grams of bilberries daily over seven days. Again, this level of consumption is not typical or recommended, given the potential adverse effects.
