Native to East Asia and grown in abundance in the American Midwest, soybeans are a staple food all around the world. In addition to serving as the base of innumerable foods, from tofu to tempeh to soy milk, soybeans can also be eaten all by themselves. These small-but-mighty beans are packed with protein and fiber, making them an ideal choice for plant-based meals and snacks.
<br><br>Since one type of soybeans is sold and marketed under the name “edamame,” you may wonder about the difference between the two terms. Edamame is simply a form of whole, immature soybean, typically boiled and served in its pod. When soybeans are left on the plant to ripen, however, they harden and develop a yellow, brown, or black hue.</p>

<h1>Soybean Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one serving (100 grams or about 1/2 cup) of french fries made from fresh potatoes and fried.
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 172</li>
  <li>Fat: 9g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 1mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 8.3g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 6g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 3g</li>
 <li>Protein: 18g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">About 30% of soybeans’ calories come from carbohydrates, and over two-thirds of these carbs are from fiber. The remaining carbs in soybeans come from naturally occurring sugars, such as sucrose and raffinose.

</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">While soybeans are by no means a high-fat food, at 9 grams per 3.5 ounces, they do contain a notable amount of dietary fat. However, these fats are primarily the “good” kind; in a single serving, you’ll take in 2 grams of monounsaturated fat and 5 grams polyunsaturated fat. The American Heart Association recommends that the majority of the fats we eat be mono and polyunsaturated. Just over 1 gram of soybeans’ total fat is the saturated variety which has been linked to heart disease.
</p>
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Protein is where soybeans really shine. In a single serving, you’ll get 18 grams of this important macronutrient. If you’re worried that this plant-based protein doesn’t measure up to the animal kind, you can put these concerns to rest. Soy is one of a select group of plant-based foods that are considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids your body needs to get through food.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Soybeans can add a number of micronutrients to your daily intake. The beans are rich in potassium, folate, magnesium, calcium, and thiamin.

</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">You may not think of beans as a stick-to-your-ribs filling food, but with so much fiber and protein per serving, soybeans can easily keep hunger at bay for a long stretch. This satiation boost may even be beneficial for weight loss.
</p>
<h1>May Lower Cholesterol </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Some research suggests that soy products can lower LDL cholesterol (aka the “bad” kind) by a small percentage. However, it’s important to note that you’d probably need to eat quite a large amount of soy to make an impact.
</p>

<h1>Boosts Digestive Health</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">So much of gut health comes down to the amount of fiber we consume. Soybeans’ 6 grams of fiber per serving adds bulk to stool and creates a healthy environment for good bacteria to flourish in the digestive tract.
