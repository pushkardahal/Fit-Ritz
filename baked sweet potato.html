<h1>Baked Sweet Potato Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The USDA provides nutritional information for one medium-sized baked potato (2” diameter, 5” long) baked, peel eaten, fat not added in cooking.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 130</li>
  <li>Fat: 0.17g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 41mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 23.6g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 3.76g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 7.39g</li>
 <li>Protein: 2.29g</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Sweet potatoes are primly made-up of carbohydrates with 23 grams per medium-sized potato without the skin and 30 grams per medium-sized potato with the skin. This includes approximately 4 grams of fiber and 7 to 9 grams of naturally-occurring sugar, with the lower figure representing a potato without the peel and the higher number a sweet potato with the peel. Sweet potatoes are a healthy source of complex carbohydrates. That said, they do have a medium glycemic index of 63, which can cause blood sugar to increase at a faster rate when compared to lower glycemic index foods.</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A baked sweet potato without added butter or oil is very low in total fat. The flesh of the potato without the peel will net you 0.171 grams for fat. If you eat the peel, that number increases slightly to 0.219 but is still well under 1/2 gram of fat per serving. 

</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Sweet potatoes are also very low in protein, with amounts ranging from 2.29 for a potato without the peel to 2.9 grams per medium-sized baked sweet potato with the peel. </p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Where sweet potatoes pack a nutritious punch is in their high vitamin and mineral content. Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin A, B6, C, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. A medium-sized sweet potato has 22,000 IU of vitamin A, 22mg of vitamin C, and 0.3mg of vitamin B.4﻿ When it comes to minerals, a medium-sized baked potato has 542mg of potassium, 43mg of calcium, 31mg of magnesium, and 0.57mg of manganese.</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Besides tasting delicious, sweet potatoes also offer significant health benefits. Here are some ways that sweet potatoes can boost your health. </p>

<h1>Boost Intake of Antioxidants </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Sweet potatoes, especially the variety with orange flesh, are high in beta-carotene, a provitamin that your body uses to make vitamin A.5﻿ Beta-carotene is considered a powerful antioxidant that can help reduce free radical damage in your body. Antioxidants can help keep the immune system healthy and may help reduce chronic diseases. Food sources such as sweet potatoes are preferred over supplements for boosting your intake of antioxidants.</p>

<h1>Improves Digestive Health</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Since sweet potatoes are high in dietary fiber, they often top the list of foods to eat for digestive health. Sweet potatoes contain both soluble and insoluble fiber, which help to relieve and prevent constipation.7﻿ However, to maximize the benefits, you should eat both the skin and the guts of the potato. The skin has insoluble fiber, which is considered the roughage. And the inside or the “guts” of the potato has soluble fiber, which slows digestion.</p>
