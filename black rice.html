Black rice (Oryza sativa) is deep, purple-colored rice also known as forbidden rice. The rice got this name because in Ancient China it was reserved only for those in the upper class. Black rice has a roasted, nutty taste and soft texture.

<h1>Black Rice Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for a one-quarter cup (45g) of medium grain dry (uncooked) black rice
</p>
<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 160</li>
  <li>Fat: 1.5g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 0mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 34g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 1g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 0g</li>
 <li>Protein: 4g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A quarter cup of dry, uncooked black rice provides about 160 calories. That amount of dried rice would make a single cooked serving of about 1/3 cup according to the package instructions of some brands.2﻿﻿ There are 32 grams of carbohydrates and about one gram of fiber in a serving of that size. There are zero grams of sugar in black rice, so the rest of the carbohydrate in black rice is starch.
</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">When cooked without added fat, there are about 1.5 grams of fat in a single-serving of black rice.</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A single serving of black rice provides about 4 grams of protein.
</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Black rice is not a significant source of micronutrients. Information provided by the USDA indicates that black rice provides about 1mg of iron or about 6% of your daily recommended value. Some commercial black rice labels also suggest that it provides 155mg of potassium or about 4% of the daily value.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Black rice contains high levels of seven different antho­cyanin polyphenols—a type of flavonoid that has antioxidant benefits.5﻿ 6

﻿ Anthocyanins are a pigment that gives black rice its deep purple color. They are also found in other red, blue, or purple foods like eggplant, blackberries, and blueberries.
</p>
<h1>May Boost Cognitive Function</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A limited study published in 2019 investigated how cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G)—a component of anthocyanin—may help improve cognitive function in older adults with subjective memory impairment. Only 48 participants were involved in the 12-week study where they consumed either a black rice extract capsule or a placebo.
</p>

<h1>May Reduce the Risk of Heart Disease</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Plant anthocyanins have been studied with regard to risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence has suggested that consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods may reduce the risk of heart disease.
