As more people switch to non-dairy and plant-based diets, manufacturers have seized this opportunity to create lactose-free alternative milk products. Populating grocery store shelves across the world, oat milk is one such popular substitute you’ll find for non-dairy milk drinkers. Cheaper to make than almond milk and environmentally friendly, oat milk contains steel-cut or whole oats soaked in water that are then blended and strained with a cheesecloth or special milk bag.
<br><br>Oat milk is dairy-free, nearly devoid of saturated fats, has more protein than most nut-based milk options, adds fiber to your diet and offers a hefty dose of B vitamins and vital minerals.

<h1>Oat Milk Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">This nutrition information, for one cup of oat milk, is provided by the USDA.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 130</li>
  <li>Fat: 5g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 115mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 244g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 1.9g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 19g</li>
 <li>Protein: 4g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs in Oat Milk</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the number of carbs in a cup of oat milk is 24,which is higher than other milk products. However, the carbs come from fiber rather than fat. Because oat milk gets made from steel-cut or whole oats, you’ll find more fiber per serving than cow’s milk (which offers no fiber), and almond and soy that contains only one gram of fiber per serving.</p> 

<h1>Fats in Oat Milk</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Oat milk contains no fatty acids, no total saturated fat and no total trans fats. The milk does have 2.5 grams of total lipid fats.

</p> 
<h1>Protein in Oat Milk</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Compared to cow’s and soy milk, oat milk does have less protein with only four grams per serving. But compared to other milk substitutes, such as almond and rice, oat milk offers more protein per serving. This is especially helpful for anyone following a vegan or dairy-free diet where lean meats and protein-rich low fat dairy products are off limits.</p>


<h1>Micronutrients in Oat Milk</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Oat milk contains thiamin and folate, both B vitamins important for energy production. The product also has necessary minerals, including copper, zinc, manganese, magnesium and trace amounts of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D, vitamin A IU, riboflavin and potassium. Most commercial oat milk, not made at home, is also fortified with vitamins A, D, B12 and B2. </p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Dairy allergies are common. According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), between two to three percent of children younger than three years old are allergic to milk. The majority, 80 percent, outgrow the allergy, but the remaining 20 percent still deal with the allergy well into adulthood. This makes needing dairy alternatives necessary for thousands of people. <br><br>
As an alternative to dairy milk for anyone allergic to dairy, lactose intolerant or following a vegan/dairy-free diet, oat milk offers some of the same health benefits you'll get from cow's milk, such as protein to build and repair tissues and keep your hair and nails looking healthy, calcium for strong bones and macronutrients like folate to make red and white blood cells in the bone marrow. </p>

<h1>Lowers your cholesterol level</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">In a study published in the Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism, researchers studied 66 men and put them into two groups: one that drank oat milk and a control group that drank rice milk for five weeks. They then switched to the other drink regime for another five-week period. Compared with the rice milk group, the oat milk group experienced significantly lower serum total and LDL cholesterol levels. The researchers concluded that oat milk has cholesterol-reducing properties</p>

<h1>May Combats cancer</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%"> According to a review of plant-based milk alternatives published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology, oat milk may contain anti-cancer properties and offers high nutritive value. </p>
