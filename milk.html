<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Milk Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits</h1></div>

Not everyone can drink milk; some have a milk protein allergy or may be sensitive to the natural sugar, lactose, found in milk. But for those who can consume cow's milk, it offers many nutritional benefits. Milk's reduced and nonfat versions provide lean protein, and all cow's milk is an excellent source of the essential mineral calcium. </p>

<h1>Kefir Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">This nutrition information, for 1 cup (8 oz.) of plain kefir is provided by the USDA.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 122</li>
  <li>Fat: 4.8g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 115mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 12g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 0g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 12g</li>
 <li>Protein: 8g</li>
 <li>Calcium: 293mg</li>
 
</ul>
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The sugar lactose provides all of the carbohydrates in milk. Some milk products also include added sugars. If you're trying to cut back on added sugars, you may want to limit your intake of these sweetened dairy products. Chocolate milk, strawberry-flavored milk, and ice milk have between 10 and 18 grams of added sugar per serving.
<br><br>Despite its carb content, the glycemic index and glycemic load of milk are low: 1 cup of 2% milk has a GI of 27 and a GL of 4.
</p> 

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Milk is marketed by its fat content, making it easier to choose between different percentages: Whole milk is 4% fat, nonfat milk is 0%, and you can also get either 1% or 2% reduced-fat milk. Over half of the fat in milk is saturated fat. One-quarter of the fat is monounsaturated fat and a minor amount is polyunsaturated fat.
<br><br>Milk can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.2﻿ However, breast milk and infant formula contain more of the fatty acids babies need, so children under 1 year old should not drink cow's milk
</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Milk is a good source of protein, with 8 grams per cup. Milk proteins contain all nine essential amino acids that humans need. Milk has 82% casein protein and 18% whey protein. These separate when milk coagulates, as is done to make cheese. These protein isolates are used in many other food products.</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Milk is a very good source of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, riboflavin, and vitamin B12. Additionally, milk in the US is fortified with vitamin D. It is also a good source of selenium, potassium, pantothenic acid, thiamin, and zinc.</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The USDA recommends including dairy foods in your diet. Milk and other dairy products help boost your calcium, protein, and vitamin D intake for strong bones and muscles. The USDA also recommends choosing dairy products without added sugars or sweeteners and those lower in fat.</p>

<h1>Improves Bone Density</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The calcium and vitamin D found in milk and other dairy products is important for bone health and strength, and may help prevent osteoporosis (a weakening of the bones that can cause fractures). Dairy product consumption in childhood and adolescence is linked to a lower risk of osteoporosis later in life.</p>

<h1>Lowers Hypertension Risk
 </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A 2013 study of over 3,000 women found an association between low dairy intake and both osteoporosis and hypertension, or high blood pressure.4﻿ A review study also found that supplemented calcium intake slightly reduces blood pressure in people without hypertension, indicating that it may play a protective role.</p>
