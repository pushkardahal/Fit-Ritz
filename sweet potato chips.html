Sweet potato chips are a variation of traditional potato chips, but are made with sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) rather than white potatoes (Solanum tuberosum). There are many different brands widely available at supermarkets all over the country. Consumers often see these chips as a healthier alternative to other starchy snacks such as French fries, fried cheese snacks, or white potato chips.
<br><br> Sweet potato chips are an excellent source of vitamin A and they provide more fiber than a comparable serving of traditional chips.

<h1>Carbs</h1>

However, keep in mind that bag size varies and the ingredients used to make the chips can also vary from brand to brand. Portion size and ingredients can change the nutrition facts.
</p>

<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are about 9 grams of fat in a bag of sweet potato chips. The type of fat can depend on what type of oil is used to fry the chips. According to USDA data, you are likely to consume about 0.8 grams of saturated fat, 2.6 grams of monounsaturated fat, and 3.4 grams of polyunsaturated fat in a serving of sweet potato chips.
</p>

<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">A single serving of sweet potato chips provides less than one gram (0.8g) of protein.</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Sweet potato chips are an excellent source of vitamin A, providing about 300 micrograms RAE (retinol activity equivalents). The recommended daily amount of vitamin A (RAE) for women is 700mcg and 900mcg for men.
</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Any health benefit that you gain from consuming sweet potato chips is likely to come from the nutrients in the sweet potatoes. The oil used to prepare the chips is most likely used in small enough quantities that it doesn't contribute any substantial benefits.
</p>
<h1>May Decrease Risk for Hypertension</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">It is possible that replacing your white potato chips with sweet potato chips may provide some benefits with regard to your risk of hypertension. But it's important to note that the link here is purely conjecture based on evidence from a study about white potato intake.
</p>

<h1>May Protect Against Vision Loss</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The vitamin A in sweet potato chips is essential for healthy vision. There is some evidence that a supplement containing vitamin A may help protect against a form of age-related vision loss called age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
