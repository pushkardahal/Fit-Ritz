Cooked jackfruit has a similar appearance and texture to pulled meat. For this reason, jackfruit has gained popularity in Western culture as a base for vegetarian meals like tacos, barbecue sandwiches, and chili. You may be wondering if jackfruit is really a healthy meat replacement. 
<br><br>While jackfruit doesn't offer the same proteins you can find in meat, it has several health benefits of note. Adding jackfruit to your meal plan can help you reach the daily recommendations of fruits and vegetables, while gaining multiple vitamins and minerals.</p>
<br><br>

<h1>Jackfruit Nutrition Facts</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 cup (165g) of sliced, raw jackfruit.</p>

<ul class="p" style="font-size:180%">
  <li>Calories: 157</li>
  <li>Fat: 1g</li>
  <li>Sodium: 3.3mg</li>
 <li>Carbohydrates: 38g</li>
  <li>Fiber: 2.5g</li>
  <li>Sugars: 32g</li>
 <li>Protein: 2.8g</li>
 
</ul>
<p style="font-size:180%">
<h1>Carbs</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Because it is a fruit, it’s not surprising that most of jackfruit’s calories come from carbohydrates. A 1-cup serving contains 38 grams of carbs, of which 2.5 grams come from dietary fiber and 32 grams come from sugar.
<br><br>Jackfruit has a glycemic index of 75 and a medium glycemic load.2﻿ Glycemic index provides an estimate of how a food might affect blood sugar levels. Foods with a score of 70 or over are considered high glycemic foods—foods that raise blood sugar levels quickly. Glycemic load takes portion size into account when providing an estimate of how a food might affect blood sugar.
</p>
<h1>Fats</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Jackfruit is extremely low in fat, with only about 1 gram per cup. Due to its low fat content and the absence of saturated fat and trans fat, jackfruit is considered a heart-healthy food.</p> 
<h1>Protein</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Despite its reputation as a replacement for pork or chicken in many main dishes, jackfruit can’t compete with these animal products in terms of protein. One cup of raw jackfruit has less than 3 grams of protein—a far cry from the 20-plus grams you’d find in a serving of most meats. It’s worth noting, though, that jackfruit has more protein than many other fruits.</p>


<h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Micronutrients are where jackfruit shines. Those looking for a potassium boost will be pleased to learn that one cup of the fruit serves up 739mg of this mineral—about 15.7% of the daily value. Additionally, the same serving of raw jackfruit contains a wealth of vitamin C (23mg or about 25% of daily value) plus respectable amounts of vitamin A, magnesium, manganese, and copper.</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Jackfruit provides many essential nutrients that help keep us healthy. Incorporating jackfruit to your eating plan gives your body important building blocks for feeling good and aging well.</p>

<h1>Supports Heart Health</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Jackfruit contains no saturated fat and is high in fiber, which makes it fit well into the American Heart Association's recommended dietary pattern. According to the organization, eating a diet high in fiber can help to lower cholesterol levels by as much as 10%.4

﻿ If you have high cholesterol, consider adding jackfruit to your grocery list. The potassium in jackfruit regulates blood pressure, reducing the risk of a heart attack or stroke.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the antioxidants in fruits and vegetables have been associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Specifically, the vitamin C content of jackfruit may help prevent plaque instability in atherosclerosis.</p>

<h1>Enhances Immunity </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">The vitamin C in jackfruit also supports the immune system, repairs cell damage, and helps the body absorb other critical nutrients like iron. People who have been exposed to cigarette smoke, extreme physical exercise, or excessively cold temperatures stand to benefit from additional vitamin C. In these populations, vitamin C has been shown to reduce the incidence of the common cold by up to 50%. Vitamin C is also a precursor to collagen, which is essential for wound healing.
<br><br>Jackfruit seeds also contain a protein called jacalin. Jacalin is a lectin that binds with certain carbohydrates. Studies have identified mechanisms by which jacalin protects CD4 (immune system) cells from HIV infection. Although there is no current vaccine against HIV, this research shows potential future promise in the treatment of the disease.</p>
