Green tea contains polyphenols (micronutrients), caffeine, and antioxidants shown to provide numerous health benefits. In fact, green tea is said to be richer in antioxidants compared to other forms of tea. The antioxidant-rich plant compounds making this drink so healthy are called flavonoids. The most common flavonoid in green tea is a catechin known as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Green tea also contains theanine (L-theanine), an amino acid shown to reduce anxiety. Other antioxidants found in green tea leaves are called proanthocyanidins and may help reduce inflammation in the body.

<h1>What Is Green Tea?</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">All green tea comes from the same plant called Camellia sinensis and is offered in several varieties. Green tea will vary in flavor and color depending on growing methods, harvesting, and processing.
<br><br>Sencha is the most commonly drunk and well-known variety of Japanese green tea. The tea leaves are said to be the best quality because they come from the first harvest. The leaves are steamed, dried, and rolled, releasing the juices within the leaves for an intense flavor.
<br><br>The harvesting process for Gyokuro green tea differs from Sencha as the green leaves are removed from sunlight about three weeks before harvest. Without direct sunlight, less photosynthesis occurs retaining strong-flavored amino acids. The tea leaves are steamed, dried, and rolled similar to Sencha; Gyokuro green tea has a richer flavor and is more costly given the additional steps to cultivate.

<h1>How to Prepare</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">There are many ways to make green tea, from iced to warm. Keep in mind that adding additional ingredients may alter the nutrition content. Check out these recipes for delicious ways to prepare this popular health drink.
</p>
<h1>Caffeine Content</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">In addition to valuable antioxidants, green tea contains about 25mg of caffeine per cup. This means it has stimulant properties, but much less than a cup of black coffee containing between 95 to 165mg of caffeine per cup. That said, experiencing the jitters typical with higher caffeine doses from a cup of coffee is usually not associated with drinking a cup of green tea.

<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Health Benefits</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Green tea is a popular nutritious drink associated with a healthy lifestyle. Because green tea contains valuable phytochemicals, it is shown to play a valuable role in disease prevention. It also has minimal calories, provides superior antioxidants, and contains a fair amount of caffeine.</p>

<h1>Lowers the Risk of Diabetes</h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Green tea contains the catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and polyphenols. Several studies indicate EGCG in green tea may help regulate blood glucose (sugar) in the body helping to prevent or control diabetes. A few other studies claim green tea to improve metabolic function directly related to a lowered risk of diabetes. There is conflicting evidence to support these claims but most research represents green tea as an attractive alternative to promoting human health, including a lowered risk of diabetes.
</p>

<h1>Supports Heart Health </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%">Several studies indicate green tea may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. The catechins in green tea, especially EGCG decrease the absorption of triglycerides (fat) and cholesterol. The reduction of fat in the blood helps to prevent plaque buildup (atherosclerosis) reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke.
